<div class="body-scroll">

<p>
All projects in <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> start with a room already in the resource tree called "<tt>Room_0</tt>". This means we don't need to create one for now, but you should rename this room to "<tt>rm_game</tt>" so it has a less generic name (this is done by performing a slow double-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_LMB.png"> on the name in the resource tree and then typing the new name). Now, what happens if we add instances of our objects to the room and test it?

<p>
Let's find out! Open the <b>Room Editor</b> by double clicking <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_LMB.png"> on the room in the resource tree. When the Room Editor opens, you'll see a lot of new tabs appear in the IDE. We're not going to worry too much about them right now, so just click and drag an instance of the object "<tt>obj_ship</tt>" into the room:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_04_01_AddInstance.gif" alt="Add An Instance To A Room">

<p>
Now drag in a few instances of the object "<tt>obj_Asteroid</tt>", so that it looks like this:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_04_02_Room.png" alt="Room With Instances Placed">

<p>
If you click the <b>Play</b> quick button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_Play.png"> now, the game will compile and you should see a window open with the instances we've placed in the room visible:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_04_03_Game.png" alt="The Game Window">

<p>
Okay, that's not very interactive, but it's a start! Seeing the game like this though does show up a minor problem... the game window is too big. We want the game to have a retro feel, so that means a smaller resolution and play area. Close the game window and go back to the room editor now.

<p>
We are going to edit the size of the room, so go to the <b>Room Properties</b> and change the <i>Width</i> and <i>height</i> to 500px each:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_04_04_RoomSize.png" alt="Change The Room Size">

<p>
This will change the room size, but may leave some instances outside of the room. You can simply click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_LMB.png"> on them then drag them back into the playable room area.

<p>
If you test play the game again, you can see that the game window is a much more appropriate size.

<div class="note">
	<b>NOTE:</b> The game window is not just governed by the room size as you can use <b>cameras</b> and <b>viewports</b> to change the window size and change what is visible inside a room. For example, to only show smaller areas of a larger room. This isn't covered in this tutorial, but look up <a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=cameras_display">Cameras</a> in the manual for more information.
</div>

<p>
We can now go back to our game objects and start to add some logic into them so they actually <i>do something</i>...
